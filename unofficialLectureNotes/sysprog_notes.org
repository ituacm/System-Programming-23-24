* Systems Programming - Unofficial Notes
** Disclaimer
Hi, I'm Denis, and here I post notes that I am taking in the class. These do not necessarily reflect the lecturer's exact words; in fact, they are deliberately distorted with my biased ideas. Whoever let me cook, made a huge mistake.

** Outline
| Order | Project            | Approach       |
|-------+--------------------+----------------|
|     1 | Device driver I/O  | Kernel module  |
|     2 | File system (FUSE) | User-space     |
|     3 | Process management | Kernel compile |

** Week 1 - Introduction and VM installation
- Kernel cannot depend on any external libraries
- Turgut Uyar's system: Lubuntu
- Dealing with the concept of system call. Specials functions with switch from user space to kernel space.
- Requirements: C compiler, Emacs, and GNU/Linux operating system
- Use virtual machine in order to not brick your computer
- Oracle VM: https://www.virtualbox.org/
- Long Term Support (LTS) versions are the most stable
- Linux, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish), English version
- Minimal system: 4 GB RAM, 1 core CPU, disk size 40 GB
- In the last project, we will compile Linux kernel, there should be enough storage
- Minimal installation, without office software, games and other crapware
- Good messaging apps: Signal, Matrix, personal email server
- Apple - devil
- [[https://youtu.be/vhk_CkUtkhE?si=gZtEuSDJAK9fqh6J][Get new phone - A Greentext Story]]
- stay off grid ó°‹‚
- Install virtualbox extensions for shared folders, clipboard, higher window size and resolution
  On the virtual machine
  #+begin_quote sh
  sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
  #+end_quote
- vboxusers: Add users to special group for interaction with the virtual box
- If host is Windows and VM is Linux, there may be conflicts between NTFS and ext4 file systems. Use only for copying files, not for compilation.
- Linus Torvalds on Oracle VirtualBox functioning worse than its open source version
  #+begin_quote
  Software is like sex: it's better when it's free.
  #+end_quote
- System Programming slides on Ni nova for extra information
- Not many tutorials on device driver and process management, because the standards change. RTFM.
** Week 2 - Kernel Modules
- Some details about rookie virtualbox, shared folder
- Commands on fresh installation
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential gcc-12
#+end_src
- You have to use the same compiler, the same version when compiling modules of a kernel
- When working with kernel modules, there is still risk of crashing the system
- [[../drivers/hello][Hello world module]]
  + *<linux/module.h>* library
  + Reason of writing *static* is to prevent exporting variables or functions, thus polluting global space. Like private.
  + *printk* - print kernel, configurable print function
  + *Makefile*, tell the system how to compile the module
  + ~ls -l~ (sometimes aliased to ~ll~) - list directory contents with detailed information
  + ~lsmod~ - list modules
  + */proc* - not an actual directory, current state of the kernel, can be viewed with ~ls~
  + */proc/modules* -  shows nearly the same information as ~lsmod~
  + modules are located at /lib/modules
  + ~uname -a~: all information about kernel
  + ~uname -r~: show kernel revision number
  + Never ignore compile warnings

  + ~sudo insmod hello.ko~ - insert module
  + When kernel sees printk, it prints to system logs
  + ~sudo tail /var/log/kern.log~ or ~dmesg~ - system logs
  + ~lsmod | grep hello~ - pipeline output of lsmod to grep (choose lines that contain hello)
  + ~rmmod <name>~ - unload module
  + Readable parameter, but cannot be changed: *module_param(variable, type, flag)*, flag S_IRUGO
  + Parameters can be changed while calling ~insmod~:
#+begin_src sh
sudo insmod hello.ko whom=Linus
#+end_src
- Device Types
  + character, block, network
  + A character device is a stream of characters that is read and written. Ex: console, mouse, serial port, sound card. Data cannot be read randomly, only serially.
  + Block device, data transfers are transferred in fixed-sized blocks. Every block is addressable and there is no need for moving the pointer. More complicated.
- Operating systems programming
  + Interrupt driven coding is better for CPU, but harder
  + Blocking is better for user-space programs, easier
  + Operating systems make interrupt look like synchronous
  + Posix interface
  + The problem of operating systems is to receive a function request, find it on the system and execute
- /dev
  + sda - +seventh day adventists+ SCSI (SKUZ-ee) Disk A
  + /dev/console - full screen console, /dev/tty - terminals, /dev/sda scsi disks, disks are emulated as scsi in modern Linux
  + /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdb2 - first and second partitions
  + ~ls -l /dev/SD*~ - view scsi disks
  + The first letter that comes after ~ls -l~ command at each row. ~c~ is character, ~-~ is regular file, ~l~ is link, ~d~ is directory.
  + major number x (driver), minor number y (actual device)
  + 256 of major number is a very small number for drivers.
  + Subsetting: Drivers can take intervals of major numbers and minor numbers.
- make clean - delete all intermediate files created after build
- [[../drivers/pseudo1.c][Registering major and minor numbers]]
  + *<linux/fs.h>* - number allocation and other
  + major number 0 -> give any major number. Otherwise, give the specified number (not a good idea).
  + alloc_chrdev_region(<address of data structure>, <starting of minor numbers>, <number of minor numbers>, <name>)
  + alloc_chrdev_region(&devno, pseudo_minor, 1, "pseudo")
  + *register_chrdev_region* -> registering a specific address region. Much higher chance to fail.
  + On exitting give the numbers back: *unregister_chrdev_region()*
  + ~grep pseudo /proc/devices~: show major numbers of devices
- Device driver interface - next week.
- I/O will not be actually implemented; instead, it will be simulated using memory manipulations. Pseudo-device.
** Week 3 - Device Driver
- Device drivers are interacted with using *open*, *close*, *read* and *write*, functions known as system calls
- For anything that is nor input nor output, *ioctl* is used. Example: configuration of peripherals in embedded systems.
- Do not confuse *open*, *close* (system calls) with *fopen*, *fclose* (call system calls)
#+begin_src C
int open(const char *path, int oflag, ...);
int close(int fd);
#+end_src
- *read*
  + fd - file descriptor
  + return value - x
  + x = nbyte: successful completion
  + x = 0: end-of-file
  + x < 0: error
  + 0 < x < count: partial transfer. Not a problem, this is a normal operation. Repeat the request for needed bytes.
#+begin_src C
  ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t nbyte);
#+end_src
- *ioctl*
  + ~int ioctl(int fd, unsigned long request, ...);~
  + No standard number of arguments
  + [[https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man2/ioctl_list.2.html][ioctl_list]]


- Normally we would use C functions instead of system calls. System calls are harder.
- ~strace~ - list system calls involved in a program
- [[../drivers/pseudo/pseudo2.c][pseudo2.c]] - open
  + Check if a driver can be opened: ~ls -l /dev/foo~. If driver does not exist, create a new node: ~sudo mknod /dev/pseudo c 240 0~
  + Create open and close system call implementations
  + *pseudo_open*, *pseudo_release*. Fixed function signature, OS sends specific parameters that cannot be changed.
  + *struct file_operations*: kernel data structure that links /open/, /release/, /owner/ etc. properties to our functions.
  + *<linux/cdev.h>*
  + *cdev_init()*
  + *cdev_add(&pseudo_cdev, devno(major and minor numbers), 1)*: function to add the event handling to kernel.
  + *struct cdev*: kernel data structure
  + *cdev_del()*: call when unloading the module
  + Usage of *&* in C allows function to modify the variable
  + We can see that the device is opened and closed in *dmesg*
  + [[https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/][Linux Device Drivers]] book provides example with multiple devices
- [[../drivers/pseudo/pseudo3.c][pseudo3.c]] - read
  + Example of reading one byte from the device
  + If you implement *read* and make a mistake, reading can crash the system.

    [[./Systems_Programming_-_Unofficial_Notes/sad_mouse.jpeg]]
  + If the function is not implemented, kernel uses a default handler, and the system won't crush.
  + *pseudo_read* puts a fixed value buf[0] = 'A'. Add to *pseudo_fops*.
  + semaphore *up(&pseudo_sem)*. Prevent multiple programs from reading at the same time. Wait on the *down* operation.
  + *sema_init();*
  + ~od octal dump -x (hexadecimal) -N /dev/pseudo~ - read 6 bytes from the pseudo-device. No need to write test functions.
  + Free A machine, it always returns 1, just like the ~yes~ command
- [[../drivers/pseudo/pseudo4.c][pseudo4.c]] - monetizing A's
  + Give one character at a time
  + dummy data is created: *pseudo_data*, *pseudo_capacity*
  + *copy_to_user*, safer function to copy data
  + Endianness is visible in ~od~
- [[../drivers/pseudo/pseudo5.c][pseudo5.c]] - give new data continuously
  + *f_pos* should be updated to read next data portions
  + ~od -v~ option
    #+begin_quote
    -v, --output-duplicates
        do not use * to mark line suppression
    #+end_quote
  + ~cat /dev/pseudo~ - continuously read from the device
  + Device accesses random data because there are no boundaries
- [[../drivers/pseudo/pseudo6.c][pseudo6.c]] - limiting *f_pos*
  + return 0 to indicate end of file
- Tasks (from easy to relatively easy)
  1) make capacity a module parameter
  2) circular read
  3) write (not circular)
  4) llseek
  5) ioctl operation: SHIFT, +n to every byte in the buffer
  6) automatically create node, without finding the major and minor numbers and calling *mknod* (hint: udev rules).
  7) create an entry in /proc
  8) create a git repository where each commit is one task
