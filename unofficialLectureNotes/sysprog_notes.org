* Systems Programming - Unofficial Notes
** Disclaimer
Hi, I'm Denis, and here I post notes that I am taking in the class. These do not necessarily reflect the lecturer's exact words; in fact, they are deliberately distorted with my biased ideas. Whoever let me cook, made a huge mistake.

** Outline
| Order | Project            | Approach       |
|-------+--------------------+----------------|
|     1 | Device driver I/O  | Kernel module  |
|     2 | File system (FUSE) | User-space     |
|     3 | Process management | Kernel compile |

** Week 1
- Kernel cannot depend on any external libraries
- Turgut Uyar's system: Debian lxqt
- Dealing with the concept of system call. Specials functions with switch from user space to kernel space.
- Requirements: C compiler, Emacs, and GNU/Linux operating system
- Use virtual machine in order to not brick your computer
- Oracle VM: https://www.virtualbox.org/
- Long Term Support (LTS) versions are the most stable
- Linux, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish), English version
- Minimal system: 4 GB RAM, 1 core CPU, disk size 40 GB
- In the last project, we will compile Linux kernel, there should be enough storage
- Minimal installation, without office software, games and other crapware
- Good messaging apps: Signal, Matrix, personal email server
- Apple - devil

- stay off grid ó°‹‚
- Install virtualbox extensions for shared folders, clipboard, higher window size and resolution
  On the virtual machine
  #+begin_quote sh
  sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
  #+end_quote
- vboxusers: Add users to special group for interaction with the virtual box
- If host is Windows and VM is Linux, there may be conflicts between NTFS and ext4 file systems. Use only for copying files, not for compilation.
- Linus Torvalds

- System Programming slides on Ninova for extra information
- Not many tutorials on device driver and process management, because the standards change. RTFM.
